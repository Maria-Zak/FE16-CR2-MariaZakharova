        <h2 class="faq-subtitle">Blog Questions:</h2>
        <h3 class="question">Question: Would it be okay with you if I posted a recipe from your blog on my own blog, website, and/or Facebook page?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">Answer: All the photos on HowToCook.recipes are copyrighted, however you are allowed share them as long as you link the photo to our original recipe. I ask that you do not copy and paste my recipes and post those on your blog. Please read my Photo
            Use & Recipe Use Policies for more details.</p>

        <h3 class="question">Question: I’m creating a Round Up and would like to include your photo. Is that okay?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">Answer: Yes, you are free to use a photo of one of our recipes with a link back to our recipe. However, please do not post the ingredients or directions for making the dish.</p>

        <h3 class="question">Question: I commented on one of your recipes and am wondering why it hasn’t been posted.</h3>

        <p class="faq-text"> Answer: I make it a point to read every comment left on our blog and do my best to respond in a timely manner, especially to any questions. I love engaging with readers and only approve comments that add value to the recipe page. All comments
            are filtered for spam and I don’t post anything derogatory or rude. I also do not post comments with links in them.</p>
        <h2 class="faq-subtitle">Frequently Asked Questions About Our Recipes:</h2>
        <h3 class="question">Question: Is there a way to print out your recipes?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">Answer: If you look above the list of ingredients on each recipe you will see a print button. Click that and you should be good to go.</p>

        <h3 class="question">Question: I tried making one of your recipes and it didn’t turn out very well. What can I do next time get it to turn out right?</h3>

        <p class="faq-text">Answer: Since I was there when you tried making it, it is very difficult to pinpoint the exact thing that went wrong. Having said that, if a recipe doesn’t turn out the first time, there are a few things you can do next time: Reread the list of
            ingredients, the amounts for each, and the directions to make sure you haven’t skipped anything. Make sure that you made no substitutions on the first try. Look up the post again and read the comments and any tips involving that recipe. If
            you still haven’t uncovered what went wrong, please leave a comment for us directly on that recipe. We will try and figure out why it didn’t work for you. Posting right on the recipe encourages others to provide feedback and perhaps offer
            suggestions.

        <h3 class="question"> Question: Would this recipe work if I used [substitute ingredient] instead of [ingredient in recipe]? </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">Answer: The recipes we’ve provided have only been made with the ingredients listed. However, there may be a lot of different ingredients that you can substitute in that will work just as well. But without trying it that way ourselves there is
            no way we could be sure. We recommend that you try the recipe first as written and then next time you can try adding your own twist.</p>
        <h3 class="question"> Question: Why would [ingredient] be included in your recipes? Ingredients like this may have chemicals in them which are not healthy. </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">Answer: HowToCook.recipes offers our readers a whole range of recipes to fit varying levels of cooking ability and eating preferences. This is why all of our recipes are not necessarily “made from scratch.” You will find recipes with packaged
            items, boxed mixes, and canned foods. If the ingredients in any given recipe don’t suit your lifestyle, we invite you to check our full index of recipes and search for the ones made from scratch.</p>
        <h3 class="question"> Question: Where can I find nutritional information on your recipes?</h3>
        <p class="faq-text">Answer: Nutritional information is provided with each recipe, but only as an estimate because cooking methods can change this, as well as the brands used. Content found on HowToCook.recipes is not meant as medical advice or information. You are
            welcome to use various nutritional calculators found online. We like CalorieKing.com because it’s so easy to use. All you have to do is copy the link to the recipe in their address bar to get the nutritional information you need. You don’t
            even have to specify the ingredients! It couldn’t be easier.</p>
